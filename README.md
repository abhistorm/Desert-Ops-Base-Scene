# Desert-Ops-Base-Scene

I am in charge of creating the whole scene in three dimensions. I created this scene with Blender, Photoshop, and Substance Painter. The new video game Tank Commander VR is the source of this scene. It can be found on the Android Play Store and works with the JioDive VR goggles. I hope my work appeals to you.
